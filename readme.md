Arduino_Minimal_PTH
====================

Crazy stupid experiment to see how small you can make an Arduino-compatible
board using through hole parts.

This design is based on the 
[Arduino Pro Mini](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardProMini) and it tries
to follow that board's I/O conventions. It eliminates everything that could be 
considered optional.

Made entirely with [free and open source software](http://www.kicad-pcb.org/).
No raptors were touched in the making of this board.

No, I haven't built it (yet?).
